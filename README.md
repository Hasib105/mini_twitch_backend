## Mini Twitch Streaming Platform

Mini Twitch is a streaming platform similar to Twitch, built with Django for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. It focuses on core features like live streaming, user authentication, and chat functionality, offering an engaging experience for both streamers and viewers. It features:

- **User Management**: Utilizes SQL for structured user data, ensuring efficient access and management.
- **Unstructured Data Storage**: Employs MongoDB (NoSQL) for handling unstructured data, such as chat messages and stream metadata.

This combination allows for a robust and flexible data architecture, enhancing the overall user experience.
